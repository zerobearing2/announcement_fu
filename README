Announcement Fu
==============

Site wide announcements made easy. 

I needed a way to provide site wide announcements for many different
projects After searching around for a plugin that already encapsulated
the announcement functionality, I realized there isn't much out there. So
in true hacker fashion, I wrote my own.

Inspired by Railscast Episode #103 - Thanks to Ryan Bates for show us the
way. http://railscasts.com/episodes/103-site-wide-announcements



Install
==============

You need to create a migration with the following:
----------------

  > script/generate migration Announcements

  class Announcements < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      create_table :announcements, :force => true do |t| 
        t.text :message  
        t.datetime :starts_at
        t.datetime :ends_at
        t.timestamps
      end
      add_index :announcements, [:starts_at, :ends_at]
    end

    def self.down
      drop_table :announcements
    end
  end

  > rake db:migrate
  
Add routes:
----------------
  
  > mate config/routes.rb

  ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map| 
    ...
    map.announcements
    ...
  end 
  
Add announcements to layout/view:
----------------

  ...
  <%= display_announcements %>
  ...


Add CSS styling (customize as needed):
----------------

  #announcement { position: absolute; z-index: 1000; left: 50%; top: 0px; width: 800px; margin-left: -400px; border: 1px solid #666; border-top: none; background-color: #FFDEDF; color: #501D00; padding: 5px; font-size: 1.1em; }
  #announcement h1, #announcement h2, #announcement h3, #announcement h4, #announcement h5 { font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: bold; }
  #announcement a { position: absolute; right: 5px; bottom: 5px; }



Configuration
==============
Default configurations:
  {
    :table => "announcements",
    :header => "Attention:",
    :hide_label => "[x] close"
  }

You may override this default by setting AnnouncementFu::Base.config inside
config/initializers or config/environment.rb, for example:

  AnnouncementFu::Base.config[:table] = "notices"
